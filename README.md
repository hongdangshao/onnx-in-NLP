# onnx-on-NLP
Since the onnx is main used in #CV, this project aims to learn the onnx in #NLP.

A demo project for textcnn model(text classification).

Try to transfer the .pth format model to .onnx format model.

If I have time, i will update and add some new project like ner/text generation and so on.
